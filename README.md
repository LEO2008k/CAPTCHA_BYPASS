# CAPTCHA_BYPASS | Perform DDoS Attack | Fake User Creation | Load User Emails | AWS SNS

This is an example script demonstrating how to exploit unprotected websites to create fake users, perform a DDoS attack, or bomb someone with emails using AWS SNS. The vulnerability has already been fixed, so I can now make it public.

This script was developed as part of CS50's Introduction to Cybersecurity course for the final project.

python3 -m venv test_web_site_venv
source test_web_site_venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
test_web_site_venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows

pip3 install -r requirements.txt
